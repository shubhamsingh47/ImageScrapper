# ImageScrapper
## Introduction:
This image scraper is a tool that allows you to scrape images from a specified website. It uses Python and the Selenium library to navigate through a website and locate images.

## Requirements:

* Python 3.x
* Selenium library
* Web driver for your browser (e.g. ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)

## Usage:
* Run the script using the command python image_scraper.py
* Enter the name of the output you want to scrape images from
* The script will then navigate through the website and download all images it finds in the specified directory.

## Customization:
* You can change the default download directory by editing the download_directory variable in the script
* You can also specify the file types you want to download by editing the allowed_formats variable in the script
* You can change the number of images to download by editing the max_images variable in the script

## Note:
* Be aware that some websites may block web scraping, so the script may not work as expected.
* Make sure to use the script in compliance with the website's terms of service.
